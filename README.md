# Filmpicker
A website for generating movie recommendations based on your favorite film!

This application requires a virtual environment with a number of auxiliary packages that are not included in the Python Standard Library. 
- The dependencies for this application are bundled up in the .yml file, environment.yml


To reproduce the environment on another machine or for another user, follow these steps:

1. Install Conda (either Anaconda or Miniconda) on the target machine.

2. Clone this repository, which should include the environment.yml file.
   
3. Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and create a new Conda environment using the environment.yml file:
  conda env create -f environment.yml

4. Activate the environment by running this command:
  conda activate filmpicker_env

Now, the environment has been reproduced with all dependencies installed.
